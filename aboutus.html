        <img src="aboutus.jpeg">
        <p><em>I</em> started clicking pictures years ago. In any case, so what? The last time anyone checked I accept that there were 1 lakh photographers in New York City, and more are pressing through the splits each day. So who am I, precisely, and for what reason am I in the state of mind to conflict with 1 lakh to 1 chance?

            All things considered, I started my vocation as an expert on-screen character, so I think about long shots. Whatâ€™s more, photography truly occurred by possibility.
            
            I never intended to be an expert photographer. Be that as it may, photography? My granddad, was an exceptionally effective photographer, with undertakings authorized by ____, and I spent a lot of my youth with him in his darkroom.
